# Machine Learning Models Implementation using NumPy and Basic Python

Welcome to the repository containing implementations of machine learning models using only NumPy and basic Python! This repository aims to provide simple, clear, and concise implementations of various machine learning algorithms without relying on external libraries. By using only NumPy and basic Python, we emphasize understanding the underlying principles of machine learning and data science concepts.

## About

This repository is designed for educational purposes and serves as a resource for those looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning algorithms and their implementations from scratch. Each model implementation is accompanied by detailed comments explaining the intuition behind the code and the mathematical concepts it embodies.

## Why NumPy and Basic Python?

Using NumPy and basic Python allows us to focus solely on the core concepts of machine learning algorithms without getting distracted by the complexities of external libraries. By writing code from scratch, we gain a deeper understanding of how algorithms work under the hood, which is essential for mastering machine learning and data science.

## Models Implemented

Currently, the repository includes implementations of the following machine learning models:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression 
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes Classifier

Each model is implemented in a modular and easily understandable manner, making it suitable for learning purposes and as a reference for building more complex models.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and explore the implementations of different machine learning models. Each model is contained within its own Python file and can be run independently.
